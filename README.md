## Astronout data analyses code (FAIR)

Helper software project with the final code version for the FAIR research software course - this is the code we are aiming to finish the course with, 
containing various imptovements made on the ["not so good" software project](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronout-data-analyses-bad) we start the course with.


## Notes (Course Team)
