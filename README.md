## Astronout data analyses code (FAIR)

This repository contains a helper software project with the final code version to be used 
for the [FAIR research software course](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-research-software).

This is the code we are aiming to finish the course with, 
containing various imptovements made on the ["not so good" software project](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronout-data-analyses-bad) 
we start the course with.

The code analyses data on spacewalks by looking at time astronauts spent in space as well as the country the space mission originated from.
